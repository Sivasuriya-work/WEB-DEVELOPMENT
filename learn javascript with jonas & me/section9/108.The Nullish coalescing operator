It's follow the principle of Nullish value

const ageGiven = 0 ;
const age = ageGiven || 18; // here age value is zero , but || operator assign 18 to age value.This problem is solved by 
//nullish coalesciring operator

const age = ageGiven ?? 18 ; // here age value is 0
const age = ageGivenOne ?? 18 ; // here age value is 18
//because of ageGivenOne value is undefined or null
