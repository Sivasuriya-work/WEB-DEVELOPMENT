Equality operator 

what ?
  Equaity operator is to do conditional operation
  It is diffrentiated in two types
    1.Strict quality operator
    2.week quality operator
    
    
    Strict quality operators check the condition strictly like the following
   
        console.log(Boolean(18 === 18)); // Strict quality operator//true
        
        console.log(Boolean(18 === "18")); //false
        
     Loosely quality operator : 

         console.log(Boolean(18 == 18)); //true
         
         console.log(Boolean(18 == "18")); //weakly quality operator//true

console.log("----------------------------------------");


LECTURE: Equality Operators: == vs. ===
1. Declare a variable 'numNeighbours' based on a prompt input like this:
prompt('How many neighbour countries does your country
have?');
2. If there is only 1 neighbour, log to the console 'Only 1 border!' (use loose equality
== for now)
3. Use an else-if block to log 'More than 1 border' in case 'numNeighbours'
is greater than 1
4. Use an else block to log 'No borders' (this block will be executed when
'numNeighbours' is 0 or any other value)
5. Test the code with different values of 'numNeighbours', including 1 and 0.
6. Change == to ===, and test the code again, with the same values of
'numNeighbours'. Notice what happens when there is exactly 1 border! Why
is this happening?
7. Finally, convert 'numNeighbours' to a number, and watch what happens now
when you input 1
8. Reflect on why we should use the === operator and type conversion in this
situation
