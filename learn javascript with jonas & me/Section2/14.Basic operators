Assignment : 
      
      let x = 5+10 // 15 value added and store into x.
        
        x= x+1; //
        x++;//    these are same , but diffrent ways of expression
        x+=1;//
        
        x++;//increment//
        x-- ; decrement
Logical : 
        
         age = 18 ;
         if(age >= 18) // conditional operator check , whether the statement is true or false.
          console.log('Get Lisence');
          
          
          
          LECTURE: Basic Operators
          
1. If your country split in half, and each half would contain half the population,
then how many people would live in each half?

2. Increase the population of your country by 1 and log the result to the console

3. Finland has a population of 6 million. Does your country have more people than
Finland?

4. The average population of a country is 33 million people. Does your country
have less people than the average country?

5. Based on the variables you created, create a new variable 'description'
which contains a string with this format: 'Portugal is in Europe, and its 11 million
people speak portuguese'

const country = 'India';

let finlandPopolation = 6;
let avgPopulation = 33;

let firstHalfPopulation = myCountryPopulation / 2;//1
let secondHalfPopulation = myCountryPopulation - firstHalfPopulation;//1

myCountryPopulation++;//2

console.log(myCountryPopulation);//3
console.log(finlandPopolation < myCountryPopulation);//4
console.log(myCountryPopulation > avgPopulation);

let description = country + " is in " + continent + ", and its " + myCountryPopulation + " million people speak " + language;//5

console.log(description);
