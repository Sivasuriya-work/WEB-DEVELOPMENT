LECTURE: Dot vs. Bracket Notation
1. Using the object from the previous assignment, log a string like this to the
console: 'Finland has 6 million finnish-speaking people, 3 neighbouring countries
and a capital called Helsinki.'
2. Increase the country's population by two million using dot notation, and then
decrease it by two million using brackets notation.
=====================================================

const myCountry = {
    country: 'India',
    capital: 'ND',
    language: 'English',
    population: 1220,
    neighbours: ['pak', 'sl', 'nepal', 'bhutan', 'china']

}
console.log(myCountry);

// console.log(`${myCountry.country} has ${myCountry.population} million ${myCountry.language} speaking people , ${myCountry.neighbours.length} neighbouring countries and a capital called ${myCountry.capital} `);
