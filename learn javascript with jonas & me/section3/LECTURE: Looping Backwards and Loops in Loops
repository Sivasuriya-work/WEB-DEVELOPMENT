LECTURE: Looping Backwards and Loops in Loops
1. Store this array of arrays into a variable called 'listOfNeighbours'
[['Canada', 'Mexico'], ['Spain'], ['Norway', 'Sweden',
'Russia']];
2. Log only the neighbouring countries to the console, one by one, not the entire
arrays. Log a string like 'Neighbour: Canada' for each country
3. You will need a loop inside a loop for this. This is actually a bit tricky, so don't
worry if it's too difficult for you! But you can still try to figure this out anyway ï¿½

===========================
const listOfNeighbours = [['canada', 'mexico'], ['spain'], ['norway', 'sweden', 'russia']];
for (let i = 0; i <= listOfNeighbours.length - 1; i++) {
    if (listOfNeighbours[i].length > 1) {
        console.log('Neighbour : ')
        for (let j = 0; j <= listOfNeighbours[i].length - 1; j++) {
            console.log(listOfNeighbours[i][j]);
        }
    }

}
