Coding Challenge #3
Let's go back to Mark and John comparing their BMIs! This time, let's use objects to
implement the calculations! Remember: BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass
/ (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter)
Your tasks:
1. For each of them, create an object with properties for their full name, mass, and
height (Mark Miller and John Smith)
2. Create a 'calcBMI' method on each object to calculate the BMI (the same
method on both objects). Store the BMI value to a property, and also return it
from the method
3. Log to the console who has the higher BMI, together with the full name and the
respective BMI. Example: "John's BMI (28.3) is higher than Mark's (23.9)!"
Test data: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m
tall.

===================================================================================

const Mark = {
    name: 'MarkMiller',
    mass: 78,
    height: 1.69,
    calcBMI: function () {
        return this.mass / this.height ** 2;
    }
}

const John = {
    name: 'John smith',
    mass: 92,
    height: 1.95,
    calcBMI: function () {
        return this.mass / this.height ** 2;
    }
}
const markBMI = Mark.calcBMI();
const johnBMI = John.calcBMI();

console.log(`${Mark.name} BMI (${markBMI}) is ${(markBMI > johnBMI) ? 'greater ' : 'lessor '}than ${John.name} BMI(${johnBMI})`);

script.js:309 MarkMiller BMI (27.309968138370508) is greater than John smith BMI(24.194608809993426)
