LECTURE: Function Declarations vs. Expressions
1. The world population is 7900 million people. Create a function declaration
called 'percentageOfWorld1' which receives a 'population' value, and
returns the percentage of the world population that the given population
represents. For example, China has 1441 million people, so it's about 18.2% of
the world population
2. To calculate the percentage, divide the given 'population' value by 7900
and then multiply by 100
3. Call 'percentageOfWorld1' for 3 populations of countries of your choice,
store the results into variables, and log them to the console
4. Create a function expression which does the exact same thing, called
'percentageOfWorld2', and also call it with 3 country populations (can be
the same populations)

//function declaration
const worldPpopulation = 7900;
function percentageOfWorld1(population) {
    return population / worldPpopulation * 100;
}

const china = percentageOfWorld1(1441);
const india = percentageOfWorld1(1200);
const usa = percentageOfWorld1(20);


console.log(`China has ${china}% , India has ${india}% , USA has ${usa}%`);



// function expression

const percentageOfWorld2 = function (population) {
    return population / worldPpopulation * 100;
}
const china2 = percentageOfWorld2(1441);
const india2 = percentageOfWorld2(1200);
const usa2 = percentageOfWorld2(20);

console.log(`China has ${china2}% , India has ${india2}% , USA has ${usa2}%`);
