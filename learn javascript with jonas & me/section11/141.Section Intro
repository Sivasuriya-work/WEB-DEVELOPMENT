Section Roadmap
Welcome to the section "Working With Arrays"!

If you want to progress through the course faster, only watch the videos marked as "Very Important" (dark green). But if you have time, then of course watch everything üòÉ

This is actually a project section, but you don't have to follow the project! You can learn the most important array methods in isolation in the "Very Important" videos.

I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to skip the "Optional" (lightest green) and "Good to know" (light green) videos. Then, if you ever need one of the topics you skipped, just come back to the video later üòâ

And now, have fun coding! ‚úåÔ∏è
