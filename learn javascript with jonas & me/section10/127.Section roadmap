Welcome to the section "A Closer Look at Functions"!

I still advise you to watch everything, but if you're in a hurry, feel free to skip the "Optional" (lightest green) and "Good to know" (light green) videos. Then, if you ever need one of the topics you skipped, just come back to the video later üòâ

And now, have fun coding! ‚úåÔ∏è
